          <h2 id="aa-introduction">Introduction</h2>
          <p>There are a variety of formats for A.A. meetings and each meeting takes on the feel of their local area. At most meetings you will hear members talk about what drinking did to them and to those around them. Most also share what actions they took to stop drinking and how they are living their lives today.</p>
          <p>The purpose of all meetings is for A.A. members to "share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism."</p>
          <h2 id="aa-meeting-types">Meeting Types</h2>
          <p>Meetings are typically listed as "open" or "closed" meetings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Open meetings are available to anyone interested in Alcoholics Anonymous’s program of recovery from alcoholism. Non-alcoholics may attend open meetings as observers.</li>
            <li>Closed meetings are for A.A. members only or for those who have a drinking problem and "have a desire to stop drinking."</li>
          </ul>
          <p>At both types of meetings, it may be requested that participants confine their discussion to matters pertaining to recovery from alcoholism.</p>
          <p>Whether open or closed, A.A. group meetings are conducted by A.A. members who determine the format of their meetings.</p>
          <h2 id="aa-where-meetings-happen">Where Meetings Happen</h2>
          <p>A.A. meetings are held in-person, online, or on the telephone. The members of each meeting decide when, where, and how often they will meet.</p>
          <p><b>In-person meetings</b> happen in a variety of places where a room can be rented. Meetings occur in places such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>office buildings</li>
            <li>churches</li>
            <li>treatment centres</li>
            <li>recreation/community centres</li>
            <li>buildings dedicated to renting to recovery groups, such as clubhouses</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can even find meetings on beaches, in parks or in other outdoor settings.</p>
          <p>Online and telephone meetings are also available. Various platforms are used depending on what the group members prefer. Some are video meetings where you see each other’s faces. At other online meetings, everyone's video is off. Still other meetings use a dial-in conference call number.</p>
          <h2 id="aa-meeting-formats">Meeting Formats</h2>
          <p><b>Discussion</b> - Whether closed or open, an A.A. member serving as “leader” or “chair” opens the meeting using that group’s format, and selects a topic for discussion.  Background for many topic meetings derives from A.A. literature, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (Big Book), Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, As Bill Sees It, Daily Reflections, and from AA Grapevine.</p>
          <p><b>Speaker</b> - One or more members selected beforehand "share" — as described in the Big Book — telling "what we were like, what happened, and what we are like now." Depending on the meeting's general guidelines (determined by the "group conscience"), some groups prefer that members who speak have a minimum period of continuous sobriety. Speaker meetings often are open meetings.</p>
          <p><b>Beginners</b> - Usually led by a group member who has been sober awhile, these are sessions to help newcomers. Beginners meetings may also follow a discussion format, or focus on Steps One, Two and Three. (A Guide for Leading Beginners Meetings is available from G.S.O.)</p>
          <p><b>Step, Tradition or Big Book</b> - Because the Twelve Steps are the foundation of personal recovery in A.A., many groups devote one or more meetings a week to the study of each Step in rotation; some discuss two or three Steps at a time. These same formats may be applied to group meetings on the Big Book or the Twelve Traditions. Many groups make it a practice to read aloud pertinent material from the Big Book or Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions at the beginning of the meeting.</p>
          <h2 id="aa-what-happens-at-meetings">What Happens at Meetings?</h2>
          <p>The chair usually opens the meeting with the A.A. Preamble and a few remarks. Some call for a moment of silence and/or recite the Serenity Prayer. The chair will often ask if there are any people new to A.A. attending the meeting who would like to introduce themselves. It isn’t mandatory to identify yourself but it might be helpful if you are attending your first meeting. Many meetings begin with a reading from the Big Book — frequently a portion of Chapter 5 (“How It Works”) or Chapter 3 (“More About Alcoholism”). A statement about anonymity in A.A. as a valuable privacy principle for new and long-time members might be read. Many meetings close with members joining in a moment of silence followed by a prayer, or perhaps by reciting the Responsibility Statement or other A.A. text.</p>
          <h2 id="aa-after-the-meeting">After the Meeting</h2>
          <p>People gather and talk, and there is a social air in the room once the meeting is over. Some may introduce themselves to you and offer their help or share their experiences getting sober. While many members find this time after the meeting valuable, it is up to you if you want to stay and socialize.</p>
          <h2 id="aa-referred-to-aa">Referred to AA Meetings</h2>
          <p>A.A. meetings welcome attendees from court programs and treatment facilities. The strength of our program lies in the voluntary nature of membership in A.A.; however many of us first attended meetings because we were pressured to by someone else. Continual exposure to A.A. educated us to the true nature of the illness.</p>
          <p>Who made the referral to A.A. is not what A.A. is interested in. It is the problem drinker who is our concern. We cannot predict who will recover, nor have we the authority to decide how recovery should be sought by any other alcoholic.</p>
          <h2 id="aa-proof-of-attendance">Proof of Attendance</h2>
          <p>Sometimes a referral source asks for proof of attendance at A.A. meetings. Groups cooperate in different ways. There is no set procedure. The nature and extent of any group’s involvement in this process is entirely up to the individual group.</p>
          <p>Some groups, with the consent of the prospective member, have an A.A. member acknowledge attendance. This may be provided  on a slip that has been furnished by the referral source, or via a digital method if the group is online. The referred person is responsible for returning the proof of attendance.</p>
          <p>Proof of attendance at meetings is not part of A.A.’s procedure. Each group is autonomous and has the right to choose whether or not to provide proof of attendance at their meeting.</p>

            <h1 id="what-to-expect-ca">Cocaine Anonymous (CA)</h1>

            <div class="content-text">
              <h2 id="ca-what-is-the-first-thing?">What is the First Thing?</h2>
              <p>To the newcomer who wonders about the first thing he or she must do to achieve sobriety, we say that you have already done the first thing: you have admitted to yourself, and now to others, that you need help by the very act of coming to a meeting or seeking information about the C.A. program.</p>
              <p>You are at this very moment doing what is necessary to stay sober: you’re not getting loaded. Cocaine Anonymous is a one-day-at-a-time program. We suggest that you not dwell on wanting to stay sober for the rest of your life, or for a year, or even a week. Once you have decided you want to quit, let tomorrow take care of itself. But sometimes it is too much for us to project even one whole day drug-free. That’s okay. Take recovery a day at a time, an hour a time, or even a minute at a time if necessary.</p>
              <p>In the C.A. Fellowship, you are among addicts who are living without drugs. Make use of us! Take phone numbers. Between meetings, you may not be able to avoid contact with drugs and people who are still using. Some of us had no sober friends at all when we first came in. You have sober friends now! If you begin to feel restless, irritable and discontented, don’t wait. Give one of us a call, and don’t be surprised if one of us calls you when we need help!</p>
              <p>It may surprise you that we discourage the use of any mind-altering substances, including alcohol and marijuana. It is the common experience of addicts in this and other programs that any drug use leads to relapse or substitute addiction. If you’re addicted to another substance, you’d better take care of it. If you’re not, then you don’t need it, so why mess with it? We urge you to heed this sound advice drawn from the bitter experience of other addicts. Is it likely you’re different?</p>
              <p>We thought we were happy in our active addiction, but we were not. In C.A., we learn to live a new way of life. Cocaine Anonymous is a spiritual but not a religious program—our spiritual values are accessible to everyone.</p>
              <p>We who are grateful recovering addicts ask you to listen closely to our stories. That is the main thing — listen! We know where you’re coming from, because we’ve been there ourselves. Yet we are now living drug-free, not only that, but living happily; many of us, happier than we have ever been before.</p>
              <p>No one says that it is easy to arrest addiction. We had to give up old ways of thinking and behaving. We had to be willing to change. But we are doing it, gratefully, one day at a time.</p>
              <h2 id="ca-meeting-types">Meeting Types</h2>
              <p>CA meetings are hosted daily in many parts of the across the globe, and online. When joining Cocaine Anonymous, people typically find a group in their local community. This group is considered the Home Group and is the group they regularly attend. There are open and closed meetings. Open meetings can be attended by anyone interested in Cocaine Anonymous, including individuals coping with cocaine addictions and family members and friends of these individuals. Closed meetings are reserved for Cocaine Anonymous members only.</p>
              <p>There are a variety of meeting types that groups may use. For example, every so often a group may need a “service” meeting where they discuss the way the group is run and any business needs. Other CA meeting types may include “book study,” “discussion,” “step study,” “H & I Meeting,” or “speaker.” Both book and step study group meetings will focus on CA literature or the 12 Steps and working through them, while a speaker meeting usually has one or two prearranged members speaking on a particular topic or experience. Discussion meetings are the traditional meeting types, while H & I meetings may be hosted at treatment facilities and be specifically for people who are receiving care there.</p>
              <h2 id="ca-benefits-of-cocaine-anonymous">Benefits of Cocaine Anonymous</h2>
              <p>Cocaine Anonymous is a no-cost, widely available resource open to anyone who has the desire to stop using cocaine. Cocaine Anonymous incorporates principles of spirituality but does not focus on one religion; thus, people from all religious and non-religious backgrounds should feel welcome. Individual therapy and 12-step programs are essential resources for recovery.</p>
              <p>Research conducted in relation to Alcoholics Anonymous suggests that people who participated in individual addiction treatment followed by long-term involvement in a 12-step program were more likely to be in remission 16 years later compared to those who only pursued one or the other. Joining a 12-step program like Cocaine Anonymous after completing initial rehabilitation can be a useful resource for maintaining abstinence and is frequently encouraged as part of many addiction recovery treatment plans.</p>
              <p>Cocaine Anonymous offers a community of people who are working toward the same goal abstinence from cocaine. Receiving support from others who have gone through, or are going through similar experiences is a valuable component of recovery. Research supports the fellowship or community cultivated among members all coping with the same issue as a primary reason that 12-step programs are effective for long-term abstinence.</p>
              <h2 id="ca-what-happens-at-meetings">What Happens at Meetings?</h2>
              <p>Cocaine Anonymous follows the concept that people are powerless over addiction and drug use, and only by accepting this and turning over their lives to a higher power can they be healed. CA is nondenominational and does not follow any specific religion, although there is a definite spiritual aspect to it. Members are encouraged to work through the 12 Steps, which involve accepting one’s faults, admitting wrongdoing and making amends, turning life over to one’s higher power, experiencing a spiritual awakening, and providing service to others in need of help achieving sobriety.</p>
              <p>Meetings are welcoming and non-judgmental, and attendance is kept confidential. Individuals can attend any, and as many, meetings as they wish, and Cocaine Anonymous encourages those battling cocaine addiction to find a “home group” that they are comfortable with and attend regularly. A home group can help individuals new to CA by providing sponsorship until a specific sponsor is set up for them. A sponsor is an individual in more sustained recovery who works with a new member to offer support.</p>
              <p>A CA meeting usually lasts about an hour and may follow this general format:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Welcome with a prayer or a reading from the Big Book</li>
                <li>Announcements or information on CA Worldwide</li>
                <li>Proclamation to keep all information that is shared confidential</li>
                <li>Discussion time where individuals can share their personal experiences if they wish to, although no one is required to share</li>
                <li>Refreshments and social time</li>
                <li>Passing the collection plate (meetings are free; donations are only recommended, not required)</li>
                <li>Closing with a prayer or moment of silence</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Each CA group is autonomous, meaning that each operates independently and is self-sufficient. Groups are funded through donations by members, and no outside contributions or influence is allowed.</p>
              <p>One of the most important aspects of CA is related to service. Members are encouraged to find some way to serve the group, either by taking a service position within the group or agreeing to be in charge of making or cleaning up the coffee and snacks before or after a meeting. This provides individuals with a sense of purpose and belonging, and ensures everyone contributes to the good of the group.</p>
              <h2 id="ca-who-should-go-to-meetings">Who Should Go to CA Meetings?</h2>
              <p>Cocaine can provide people with a temporary escape from reality and an artificial spike in energy, focus, and pleasure. It also makes them seem more social and talkative. Cocaine may be used as a way to cope with stress or other painful emotions. When cocaine use is stopped, a person may feel tired, lethargic, unhappy, and isolated.</p>
              <p>Cocaine Anonymous can offer social and emotional support from other individuals who have been there and understand. A sense of community is formed, giving individuals the social network they may feel was lost when they stopped using drugs. These bonds can be lasting, as CA members work together to achieve the common goal of sobriety and maintained abstinence. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines hope as being one of the foundations of recovery. Cocaine Anonymous may help individuals to find and expand upon that hope.</p>
              <p>Stress is a common trigger for substance abuse. By working through the steps taught in CA meetings, participants can learn new coping mechanisms and techniques for managing stressors that don’t involve cocaine or any substance use. Peer support and peer pressure can be powerful, and CA is a network of peers that provide healthy peer pressure and a level of support that others who haven’t experienced cocaine addiction may not completely understand.</p>
              <p>A return to drug use after a period of being sober is called relapse, and this is common during recovery. Relapse may be especially dangerous in the case of cocaine abuse, as individuals may return to using the drug at levels they were used to before getting sober. This may overwhelm the system and cause a potentially life-threatening overdose. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) reported that in 2014, close to 6,000 Americans died from a cocaine overdose. Relapse may be minimized and the potential outcome positively influenced by regular participation in a support group like Cocaine Anonymous.</p>
              <p>Members of CA can be there for each other, provide tips for controlling drug cravings, and help each other from returning to cocaine use. Complete abstinence from abusing mind-altering substances is one of the overarching themes and goals of 12-Step programs. Active involvement and participation in a self-help and peer support group like CA can reduce relapse and increase the chances that someone will remain abstinent, the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment publishes.</p>
              <h2 id="ca-finding-a-group">Finding a CA Group</h2>
              <p>CA groups exist in more than 20 countries, and there are even options to join online meetings as well. This website provides a directory of Cocaine Anonymous meetings in the UK.</p>
              <p>Substance abuse treatment providers and facilities are also great resources for helping individuals and families find CA meetings that are local. In addition, primary care providers and mental health professionals can offer referrals to local meetings.</p>
              <p>Individuals do not have to do anything prior to a meeting; just show up to a scheduled meeting. CA meetings are open not only to individuals struggling with cocaine addiction, but also to those who abuse other mind-altering substances.</p>

              <h2 id="na-introduction">Introduction</h2>
              <p>For people struggling with drug use, one recovery tool that’s been available for decades is Narcotics Anonymous (NA). This free program provides support in the form of regular group meetings and fellowship with other people with addictions. Here’s what to expect from NA.</p>
              <p>NA started in California in the 1950s as an offshoot of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Today, it holds more than 70,000 regular meetings in 144 countries. The program is open to anyone who is addicted to drugs. There are no membership fees, and NA is an independent organization with no links to any treatment centres or religious groups.</p>
              <p>Like AA, NA’s mission is complete abstinence. Members meet regularly to share their experiences and support each other to quit drugs.</p>
              <p>NA follows the Twelve Steps principle to guide its members on the path to recovery. The 12 steps mention God, but NA stresses that this isn’t necessarily a religious figure but sort of a power outside of yourself that helps motivate you. In fact, many NA members identify as atheist or agnostic.</p>
              <h2 id="na-meeting-formats">Meeting Formats</h2>
              <p>It is critical for successful recovery to choose the right NA meeting format. There is a wide variety of formats to accommodate the needs of every person regardless of their background and history of addiction.</p>
              <p><b>Open Sessions</b> - Open NA meetings allow families, prospective participants, and other members of the community to be present during the gathering. Only regular attendees are allowed to actively participate, which reduces the pressure that some individuals may feel.</p>
              <p><b>Closed Meetings</b> - A closed NA meeting is available for everyone who acknowledges having a problem with addiction. These meetings are designed to grant people a high sense of comfort and security to help them share and socialize.</p>
              <p><b>Specific Group Gatherings</b> - Specific Narcotics Anonymous group meetings are restricted by certain group characteristics. For instance, there are women-only meetings, as well as groups for newcomers, members of the LGBT community, and various religions.</p>
              <p><b>Topic / Discussion Meetings</b> - All participants may choose to attend sessions that are centered around discussions relevant to their recovery. Such NA meeting topics usually don’t revolve around substance abuse itself.</p>
              <p><b>Speaker Meetings</b> - At a speaker NA meeting, a professional, a successfully recovered person, or a motivational speaker give a presentation to inspire the participants. These meetings may be open, closed, or restricted based on demographics.</p>
              <p><b>Big Book Study</b> - Big Book NA meeting focuses on studying and discussing the text of The Big Book by Bill W. Although the book itself describes the recovery from alcohol addiction, it is frequently introduced into Narcotics Anonymous meetings as well.</p>
              <p><b>12-Step Study</b> - NA meetings with the 12-step study format explore one or several steps per gathering. These groups may be divided by religion or lack thereof, as some of the steps may contain spiritual exercises.</p>
              <h2 id="na-what-happens-at-meetings">What Happens at Meetings?</h2>
              <p>NA meetings may be open or closed. Anyone can drop in an open meeting, including friends and relatives, community members, and college students studying substance abuse. Closed meetings are reserved only for those with addiction issues. This often helps members feel more comfortable about opening up.</p>
              <p>The group’s facilitator will ask at the beginning of the meeting if there are any new members in attendance. This is your chance to raise your hand and introduce yourself. There will be people at the meeting who are also new to the program. Others may have quit using for a long time.</p>
              <p>A meeting usually runs between 60-90 minutes. In a discussion meeting, members are given opportunities to speak and share their experiences. Speaking time is usually under 5 minutes. There may also be readings or group discussions about particular topics. Speaker meetings give members a chance to talk for longer.</p>
              <p>You’ll receive a welcome key tag on your first visit. You'll get another one after 30 days to commemorate the work you’ve put in. You'll also get key tags when you reach 60 days, 90 days, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 18 months, and then yearly from that point on.</p>
              <p>The meetings aren’t meant to be group therapy sessions. The goal is to create a safe environment where people addicted to substances can connect with each other and support each other’s recovery.</p>
              <h2 id="na-who-is-welcome">Who is Welcome?</h2>
              <p>NA is welcome to any person who thinks they’re addicted to substances and wants to change their life. If for any reason you walk away from your first meeting feeling like you didn’t connect with the style or the people there, you can try a different meeting to find the right fit for you.</p>
              <p>If you want to continue with the program, NA recommends that new members go to a meeting every day for at least 90 days. From there, progress looks different for everyone. You may be nervous at your first meeting, and it may take some time for you to feel like you can stay with the program and your recovery. Soon you may start to feel a sense of belonging and even make some friends. In general, the more invested you are in the NA program, the more helpful it will be for you.</p>
              <p>NA believes in an abstinence model of recovery, which means being completely drug free. But if you’re addicted to opioids, you may be taking buprenorphine maintenance therapy (BMT). You are welcome to attend meetings if you are on BMT. The group’s official position is that the only criteria for membership is a desire to stop using drugs.</p>
              <p>If you are open about your drug replacement therapy, however, you may be asked not to speak at an NA meeting and simply listen. You’re free to chat with others during breaks or afterward. You may not get the full benefits of actively taking part in meetings. Some other members may informally try to get you to stop your BMT.</p>
              <p>Still, researchers found that there may be some benefits in going to NA meetings for people who are taking BMT. Many experts agree that socializing with others and doing service work can be powerful tools for those recovering from addiction.</p>

            <h2 id="oa-what-happens-at-meetings">What Happens at Meetings?</h2>
            <p>We gather around a table or in a circle of chairs. Our meetings follow a format (like a script) that a volunteer leader reads. The format usually includes reading the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions. Other OA literature may also be read. The leader may ask “Is there is anyone here attending their first, second, or third OA meeting?” Members are asked to introduce themselves using first names only. The meeting may present a speaker or read from OA literature or the OA magazine. Then the meeting is opened for “shares.” These are often timed so everyone at the meeting who wishes to can share. You do NOT have to share, but you can. Halfway into the meeting (most meetings are one hour long), we pass the basket for contributions to pay the rent and support OA and make announcements. Newcomers are encouraged to consider buying literature rather than contribute as you do not yet know if you are planning to join OA. Then the meeting opens for shares again. The point of shares is to talk about our issues and how working the Twelve Step program of OA is helping us recover. The meeting ends with an OA closing and everyone who wishes to join hands in a circle does so. As the meeting breaks up, this is a great time to ask members questions you may have about OA and what you heard. A member may offer to call you to follow up and answer any more questions you have once you have had a chance to look at the newcomer brochure "What Do I Do Now?"</p>
            <p>First of all: deep breath. There's nothing to be nervous about. You will be welcome. You’ll find you are not alone anymore. Everyone at the meeting knows where you’re coming from about food. Here’s what happens at a typical meeting, but all meetings are a little different.</p>
            <p>Once you've found a meeting that you want to check out, you show up. Set aside an hour for your meeting. Consider this "you" time. You’ll meet others like you with a simple first name introduction and be genuinely welcomed. Get yourself settled with the group to enjoy various readings, members sharing their journeys, and learning more about OA. Participate as much or as little as you want. You are welcome to share but you don’t have to. If you have questions, you can talk with individual members after the meeting. Congratulations—you completed your first meeting!</p>
            <p>But, wait. What about the weigh-in? What about paying a membership fee? There’s none of that. When people become members, they often voluntarily contribute, but it’s never required. We promise.</p>
            <p>So, to recap, at OA there’s …</p>
            <ul>
              <li>No weigh-in</li>
              <li>No membership fee</li>
              <li>No judgment</li>
              <li>No religion (we're a spiritual group)</li>
              <li>A safe place for everyone (all genders, races, ages, sexual orientations, sizes)</li>
              <li>A program that works</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Hope… and there are people who will understand.</p>
            <p>To find the meeting that works for you we suggest you try a variety.</p>
            <h2 id="oa-meeting-formats">Meeting Formats</h2>
            <p>When you arrive at the meeting, you will find men and women who share a common problem — compulsive eating — and have found a common solution: the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous.</p>
            <p>Meetings vary in size from as few as three members to fifteen or even more in larger towns. Many members attend more than one meeting a week. You will be warmly welcomed.</p>
            <p>The meeting usually opens with the Serenity Prayer, and you may hear a reading called "Our Invitation to You," which describes the disease of compulsive overeating and the Twelve-Step solution. Meeting formats may vary, but all OA groups are the same in that they seek recovery on three levels - physical, emotional and spiritual - through the Twelve Steps, and the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop eating compulsively.</p>
            <p>Although meeting formats vary, you may hear a speaker open the meeting and speak for 10 to 15 minutes about what life was like before OA, what happened, and what he or she is like now; or someone might read from OA or AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) literature. Other members will share their experience, strength and hope. You will have an opportunity to introduce yourself as a newcomer, if you like. You will find that you are not alone, that there is a way out of your desperation. Because anonymity is a critical principle of the OA programme, you are assured that what you share will be held in confidence. This provides the safety you need to share your experiences honestly.</p>
            <p>You may recognise your own story when you listen to others share. Listening will help you find others who have what you want, whether it be weight loss, clarity, joy in achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight, or freedom from the obsession of self-destructive eating behaviours.</p>
            <p>When members share, you may hear them refer to a Higher Power or to God. OA is not a religious programme and does not subscribe to any specific religious ideology. It is a programme that practices spiritual principles, and members individually approach these principles with a Higher Power of their understanding. You can read or listen to some shares from OA members here.</p>
            <p>Meetings usually last between one and one and a half hours. Before and after the meeting, feel free to ask questions and obtain some OA literature to help you learn about the programme. By asking for help, you are taking an important step toward recovery.</p>
            <p>Because OA is self-supporting through member contributions, a basket will be passed for donations which are used to pay rent, buy literature and help support OA’s service bodies.</p>
            <p>You will notice that some members volunteer to help keep the meeting going, such as the group secretary, and treasurer. Members find that doing service in OA helps keep them from eating compulsively. Service is important to their recovery and allows them to give back to the Fellowship that has saved their lives. Service opportunities exist in all levels of the Fellowship, from setting up chairs at a meeting to being on the Board of Trustees.</p>
            <p>The meeting usually ends with the OA Promise, "I Put My Hand in Yours," or a similar closing. All meetings have a slightly different feel, so try attending as many other groups at other times and locations that you can. It is a good idea to attend at least six meetings to learn the many ways OA can help you. If your area doesn’t offer a large number of face-to-face meetings, there are online or telephone meetings at www.oa.org.</p>
            <p>What you WON’T find at OA meetings are:</p>
            <p>Weigh-ins, packaged meals, fixed fees, “shoulds” or judgement.</p>
            <p>What you WILL find at meetings is:</p>
            <p>Acceptance of you as you are now, as you were, as you will be. Understanding of the problems you now face - problems almost certainly shared by others in the group. Recovery from your illness. Power to enter a new way of life through the practice of the Twelve-Step recovery programme, the belief in a power greater than yourself, the OA tools and the support and companionship of the group.</p>
            <p>If you decide that you are one of us, we welcome you with open arms. Whatever your circumstances, we offer you the gift of acceptance. You are not alone any more. Welcome to Overeaters Anonymous. Welcome home!</p>
