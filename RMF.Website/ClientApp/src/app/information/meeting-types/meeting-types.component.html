          <p>Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for AA membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions.</p>
          <p>AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.</p>
          <p>It doesn’t cost anything to attend AA meetings. There are no age or education requirements to participate. Membership is open to anyone who wants to do something about their drinking problem. <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/Who_Me_Revised.pdf" target="_blank">Who Me?</a></p>
          <p>Members enter AA through multiple routes, and membership is diverse. Research has documented a significant correlation between AA attendance and successful outcomes. Those more involved with the AA program tend to do best. </p>

          <p>AA is a program for living that emphasizes abstinence from alcohol, personal and spiritual growth, and reliance on a higher power of your own understanding which can be anything you choose. <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/p-42_0322.pdf" target="_blank">A Brief Guide to AA</a>.</p>
          <p>AA is nonprofessional — it doesn’t have clinics, doctors, counsellors or psychologists. All members are themselves recovering from alcoholism. There is no central authority controlling how AA groups operate. It is up to the members of each group to decide what they do. However, the AA program of recovery has proved to be so successful that almost every group follows it in very similar ways.</p>
          <p>AA works through members telling their stories of what we used to be like, what happened and what we are like now. The AA program, known as The Twelve Steps, provides a framework for self-examination and a road to recovery, free of alcohol.</p>
          <p>It combines peer accountability, coping skills, and daily connections with 12 actionable steps that are designed to change your relationship with alcohol.</p>
          <p>The Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous are designed to challenge the out-of-control thoughts and behaviours that drive addiction. In clinical terminology, this process is called cognitive restructuring, which means AA changes the way you think about drinking.</p>

          </div>
          <p>AA meetings are held in-person, online, or on the telephone. The members of each meeting decide when, where, and how often they will meet with the format and different rules set out at the beginning of the meeting. <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/p-16_theaagroup.pdf" target="_blank">The Group Leaflet</a>.</p>
          <p>There are a variety of formats for AA meetings and each meeting takes on the feel of their local area. At most meetings you will hear members talk about what drinking did to them and to those around them. Most also share what actions they took to stop drinking and how they are living their lives today.</p>
          <p>Meetings are typically listed as "open" or "closed" meetings. Using our website you can select from accessibility options to search for the type of meeting you are looking for.</p>
          <p><b>Open meetings</b> are available to anyone interested in Alcoholics Anonymous’s program of recovery from alcoholism. Non-alcoholics may attend open meetings as observers but they must keep to the tradition of anonymity regarding anything they hear at the meeting.</p>
          <p><b>Closed meetings</b> are for AA members only or for those who have a drinking problem and “have a desire to stop drinking.”</p>
          <p><b>Online and telephone meetings</b> are also available. Various platforms are used depending on what the group members prefer. Some are video meetings where you see each other’s faces. At other online meetings, everyone's video is off. Still other meetings use a dial-in conference call number. We hope to add a directory of online video meetings to this website soon.</p>
          <p>AA meetings are widely available with an estimated 87,000 AA groups around the world. The estimated membership of AA is over 1.7 million members in 150 countries.

          </div>
          <p>Fun and friendship are a huge part of Alcoholics Anonymous. AA meetings are a great place to meet and socialize with others who are on the same journey. Together, fellow alcoholics hold each other accountable without being judgmental.</p>
          <p>AA began with sponsorship. When Bill W, only a few months sober, was stricken with a powerful urge to drink, this thought came to him: "You need another alcoholic to talk to. You need another alcoholic just as much as he needs you!". He found Dr Bob, who had been trying desperately to stop drinking, and out of their common need AA was born. Dr Bob in turn safeguarded his own sobriety by sponsoring countless other alcoholics. <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/p-15_en_0722.pdf" target="_blank">Questions &amp; Answers on Sponsorship</a>.</p>
          <p>Essentially, sponsorship is one alcoholic who has made some progress in the recovery programme sharing that experience on a continuous, individual basis with another alcoholic who is trying to stay sober. Most present members of AA owe their sobriety to the fact that someone took a special interest in them and was willing to share a great gift with them.</p>
          <p>Many of us found in our early days that we needed close support as we began learning how to "live sober." So we asked an AA member with whom we felt comfortable to be our sponsor. Whether you are a newcomer who is hesitant about "bothering" anyone, or a member who has been around for some time trying to go it alone, we urge you: Do not delay. An alcoholic who has made some progress in the recovery programme wants to share what they have learned with other alcoholics. We know from experience that our own sobriety is greatly strengthened when we give it away.</p>
          <p>Peer support and sponsorship also functions as a safety net, especially in the first few months when cravings are the strongest. Being able to reach out to someone who is a sponsor and has been through the process can save you when you’re thinking about drinking. It is suggested you find a sponsor as soon as possible when you first start attending meetings.</p>

          </div>
          <p>None of us would be here today if it were not for the service of those who came before. What can we do today to be of service to the alcoholic yet to come?</p>
          <p>Our Twelfth Step — carrying the message — is the basic service that the AA Fellowship gives; this is our principal aim and the main reason for our existence. Therefore, AA is more than a set of principles; it is a society of alcoholics in action. We must carry the message, else we ourselves can wither and those who haven’t been given the truth may die. Hence, an AA service is anything whatever that helps us to reach a fellow sufferer — ranging all the way from the Twelfth Step itself to a ten-cent phone call and a cup of coffee, and to AA’s General Service Office for national and international action. </p>
          <p>As we work through the 12-Steps, often with the help of a sponsor, we soon find that there are many ways of participating in our service structure.</p>
          <p>Some AA members gain a sense of purpose by showing up to meetings early and making coffee for everyone. Other members do important service work by sponsoring newcomers, sharing their story as speakers at meetings, or delving deeper into the spiritual aspects of the program. <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/3340 Growing into Service.pdf" target="_blank">Growing into Service</a>.</p>

          <p>AA is not a religious organisation nor is it affiliated with any religious body. It welcomes members of all religions, agnostics and atheists alike. <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/3267 The God Word.pdf" target="_blank">The God Word</a>.</p>
          <p>You don’t have to sign up or achieve anything to be a member. You’re a member of a group if you choose to be. You can come and go as you please. No one is “in charge” of a group. We work through the offer of help and suggestion only. No one can tell you what you should or shouldn’t do.</p>
          <h2 id="aa-anonymity">Anonymity</h2>
          <div class="leaflet-image-container">

          </div>
          <p>Traditionally, AA members have always taken care to preserve their anonymity at the "public" level: press, radio, television, films and the new media technologies such as the internet.  <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/p-47_understandinganonymity.pdf" target="_blank">Understanding Anonymity</a>.</p>
          <p>In the early days of AA, when more stigma was attached to the term "alcoholic" than is the case today, this reluctance to be identified — and publicised — was easy to understand. As the Fellowship of AA grew, the positive values of anonymity soon became apparent.</p>
          <p>First, we know from experience that many problem drinkers might hesitate to turn to AA for help if they thought their problem might be discussed publicly, even inadvertently, by others. Newcomers should be able to seek help with complete assurance that their identities will not be disclosed to anyone outside the Fellowship.  Then, too, we believe that the concept of personal anonymity has a spiritual significance for us – that it discourages the drives for personal recognition, power, prestige, or profit that have caused difficulties in some societies. Much of our relative effectiveness in working with alcoholics might be impaired if we sought or accepted public recognition.</p>
          <p>While each member of AA is free to make his or her own interpretations of this AA tradition, no individual is ever recognised as a spokesperson for the Fellowship locally, nationally, or internationally. Each member speaks only for himself or herself. AA is indebted to all media for their assistance in strengthening the Tradition of anonymity over the years.</p>

          <p>Cocaine Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other so that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from their addiction. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using cocaine and all other mind-altering substances.

          <p>There are no dues or fees of any kind. To be a member, you only have to want to quit. The only purpose of Cocaine Anonymous is to offer recovery to individuals who are suffering from addiction.

          <p>CA is a non-profit organization that follows the guidelines of the 12 Steps and 12 traditions outlined by <a href="javascript:void(0)" (click)="scrollTo('alcoholics-anonymous')">Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)</a> for becoming and remaining abstinent. Many years of experience have demonstrated the value of one addict helping another. CA is a fellowship of addicts who meet together to share our hope, faith, and courage for the purpose of staying sober and helping others achieve the same freedom.</p>
          <p>The only requirement for attending a CA meeting is that the person wants to stop using, or continue abstaining from, cocaine or other psychoactive substances. CA provides fellowship and a high level of social support that can help individuals struggling with cocaine addiction to sustain long-term recovery that is free from cocaine and drug abuse.</p>
          <p>CA follows the concept that people are powerless over addiction and drug use, and only by accepting this and turning over their lives to a higher power of their own understanding can they be healed completely. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_First_30_Days_2017.pdf" target="_blank">The First 30 Days</a>.</p>

          </div>
          <p>CA meetings are held all over the world, and there are no requirements in order to attend or join a group. No fees are collected, no paperwork is required, and signing up is unnecessary.

          <p>A typical meeting will be either <b>"open"</b>, meaning that anyone – including friends, families, and caregivers can attend, providing they keep to the tradition of anonymity, or a <b>"closed"</b>, meaning it is only meant for those battling cocaine addiction themselves.</p>
          <p>There are a variety of meeting types that groups may use. For example, every so often a group may need a "service" meeting where they discuss the way the group is run and any business needs. Other CA meeting types may include "book study", "discussion", "step study", "H & I Meeting", or "speaker." Both book and step study group meetings will focus on CA literature or the 12 Steps and working through them, while a speaker meeting usually has one or two prearranged members speaking on a particular topic or experience. Discussion meetings are the traditional meeting types, while H & I meetings may be hosted at treatment facilities and be specifically for people who are receiving care there.</p>

          <p>Newcomers are welcomed to CA with more genuine warmth and acceptance in our hearts than you can probably now imagine — for you are the lifeblood of our program.

          <p>Individuals can attend any, and as many, meetings as they wish, and Cocaine Anonymous encourages those battling cocaine addiction to find a “home group” that they are comfortable with and attend regularly. A home group can help individuals new to CA by providing sponsorship until a specific sponsor is set up for them. A sponsor is an individual in more sustained recovery who works with a new member to offer support. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_The_Home_Group_2017.pdf" target="_blank">The Home Group</a>.</p>
          <p>Each CA group is autonomous, meaning that each operates independently and is self-sufficient. Groups are funded through donations by members, and no outside contributions or influence is allowed.</p>

          </div>
          <p>You’ve likely heard lots of talk at Cocaine Anonymous meetings about working the Twelve Steps of recovery, finding a Power greater than ourselves, and getting a sponsor. If you’re like most newcomers, however, you’re probably not sure what all these terms mean.</p>
          <p>This is why it’s a good idea to get a sponsor. A sponsor can devote individual attention to answering your questions regarding the CA program of recovery. It can also help you feel more comfortable to be with someone who knows his or her way around. A sponsor can introduce you to other CA members, help you get involved in service and encourage you to participate in Fellowship events, all of which are vital to a successful program of recovery. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_Choosing_Your_Sponsor_2017.pdf" target="_blank">Choosing Your Sponsor</a>.</p>
          <p>A sponsor is a recovering addict who shares one-on-one how to maintain sobriety by working the Twelve Steps of CA A sponsor’s primary tools are his or her own experience, strength and hope. Sponsors are not professional counsellors and are not certified to offer legal, psychiatric or medical advice. Nor should we become dependent on our sponsors to get us jobs, clothing or food. However, sponsors may have experience with how to obtain professional help or other resources.</p>

          <p>One of the most important aspects of CA is related to service. Members are encouraged to find some way to serve the group, either by taking a service position within the group or agreeing to be in charge of making or cleaning up the coffee and snacks before or after a meeting or sponsorship positions.

          <p>We came into the program with big egos but little or no self-esteem. We thought we were better than other people yet, at the same time, felt "less than." We were people who took from others and abused friendships all of our lives. We had no concept of doing anything for anyone without the thought of some kind of reward. By the sheer grace of our fellowship, we have found several ways of unlearning such behaviour in the program. One way is to be of service to the fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous. We discovered that the best way was to serve our fellow humans, and we found humility in the process. Our self-centred behaviour was gradually replaced with the "attitude of service." We learned that service is about gratitude and learning how to contribute to our lives and the lives of others.</p>

          <p>CA is nondenominational and does not follow any specific religion, although there is a definite spiritual aspect to it. Members are encouraged to work through the 12 Steps, which involve accepting one’s faults, admitting wrongdoing and making amends, turning life over to one’s higher power, experiencing a spiritual awakening, and providing service to others in need of help achieving sobriety. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_A_Higher_Power_2017.pdf" target="_blank">A Higher Power</a>.</p>
          <p>In order to maintain our integrity and avoid any possible complications, we are not affiliated with any outside organization. Although CA is a spiritual program, we do not align ourselves with any religion. Our members are free to define their spirituality as they see fit. </p>

          <p>In CA we are all on equal footing. We are men and women of all ages, races and social backgrounds, with the common bond of addiction. Everything heard at our meetings is to be treated as confidential. Meetings are welcoming and non-judgmental, and things mentioned or talked about during the meeting, and attendance should be confidential and anonymous. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_Anonymity_2017.pdf" target="_blank">Anonymity</a>.</p>
          <p>One definition of “anonymous” is “nameless.” Anonymity is vital to the continued growth and existence of Cocaine Anonymous, and the Fellowship’s name contains an implicit promise of privacy. By treating who we see and what we hear at our meetings as confidential, CA remains a safe place to share our experience, strength and hope.</p>
          <p>We may exchange phone numbers, and give and seek support from one another between meetings but remain focused on keeping our anonymity.</p>

            <p>Narcotics Anonymous is a non-profit fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem. We are recovering addicts who meet regularly to help each other stay clean. This is a program of complete abstinence from all drugs. There is only one requirement for membership, the desire to stop using. We suggest that you keep an open mind and give yourself a break. Our program is a set of principles written so simply that we can follow them in our daily lives. The most important thing about them is that they work.</p>
            <p>There are no strings attached to NA. We are not affiliated with any other organizations. We have no initiation fees or dues, no pledges to sign, no promises to make to anyone. We are not connected with any political, religious, or law enforcement groups, and are under no surveillance at any time. Anyone may join us regardless of age, race, sexual identity, creed, religion, or lack of religion.</p>
            <p>NA is a global, community-based organization with a multilingual and multicultural membership. NA was founded in 1953, and members hold nearly 76,000 meetings weekly in 143 countries today. <a href="/leaflets/narcotics-anonymous/EN3129.pdf" target="_blank">An Introduction to NA Meetings</a>.</p>
            <p>NA is a completely voluntary organisation. Membership is open to anyone with a drug problem seeking help, regardless of what drug or combination of drugs have been used, and irrespective of age, sex, religion, race, creed or class. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using drugs. We are recovering addicts who meet regularly to help each other stay clean. This is a program of complete abstinence from all drugs. There is only ONE requirement for membership, the desire to stop using.</p>
            <p>Anyone who wants to stop using drugs may become a member of Narcotics Anonymous. Membership is not limited to addicts using any particular drug. Those who feel they may have a problem with drugs, legal or illegal, including alcohol, are welcome in NA. Recovery in NA focuses on the problem of addiction, not on any particular drug.</p>
            <p>People have all sorts of reasons for attending NA meetings, but the purpose of each meeting is to give NA members a place to share recovery with other addicts.</p>
            <h2 id="na-how-it-works">How it Works?</h2>
            <div class="leaflet-image-container">
              <a href="/leaflets/narcotics-anonymous/AN3122.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/about/meeting-types/narcotics-anonymous/welcome-to-narcotics-anonymous.png" /></a>
            </div>
            <p>We offer recovery from the effects of addiction through working a twelve-step program, including regular attendance at group meetings. The group atmosphere provides help from peers and offers an ongoing support network for addicts who wish to pursue and maintain a drug-free lifestyle. Our name, Narcotics Anonymous, is not meant to imply a focus on any particular drug; NA’s approach makes no distinction between drugs including alcohol. Membership is free, and we have no affiliation with any organizations outside of NA including governments, religions, law enforcement groups, or medical and psychiatric associations. <a href="/leaflets/narcotics-anonymous/AN3122.pdf" target="_blank">Welcome to Narcotics Anonymous</a>.</p>
            <p>We are not interested in what or how much you used or who your connections were, what you have done in the past, how much or how little you have, but only in what you want to do about your problem and how we can help. The newcomer is the most important person at any meeting, because we can only keep what we have by giving it away. We have learned from our group experience that those who keep coming to our meetings regularly stay clean.</p>
            <p>Narcotics Anonymous offers recovery to addicts around the world. We focus on the disease of addiction rather than any particular drug.  Our message is broad enough to attract addicts from any social class or nationality. When new members come to meetings, our sole interest is in their desire for freedom from active addiction and how we can be of help.</p>
            <p>Our program of recovery begins with abstinence from all drugs, including alcohol. Sometimes people come to NA meetings while still using drugs, detoxing from drugs, or on drug replacement therapy. Regardless of what you may be taking when you first come to NA, you are welcome. </p>
            <h2 id="na-meeting-formats">Meeting Formats</h2>
            <div class="leaflet-image-container">
              <a href="/leaflets/narcotics-anonymous/Group Booklet.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/about/meeting-types/narcotics-anonymous/the-group.png" /></a>
            </div>
            <p>When two or more addicts come together to help each other stay clean, they may form a Narcotics Anonymous group. NA groups are formed by addicts who wish to support one another in recovery, in carrying the message directly to other addicts, and in participating in the activities and services of NA as a whole. One of the primary means an NA group uses to fulfil these ends is to conduct NA meetings where addicts can share their recovery experience, thus supporting one another and at the same time carrying the message to others. Some groups host a single weekly meeting; others host a number of meetings each week. <a href="/leaflets/narcotics-anonymous/Group Booklet.pdf" target="_blank">The Group</a>.</p>
            <p>An <b>"open"</b> meeting is an NA meeting that may be attended by anyone (e.g., judges, probation officers, professionals, family members) interested in how we have found recovery from the disease of addiction.  Verbal participation, however, is limited to NA members only.  An open meeting in Narcotics Anonymous allows people from outside of the fellowship to observe what Narcotics Anonymous is and how it functions.  This can be very helpful to those individuals who are striving to reach a decision regarding their personal status as an addict.  An open meeting in Narcotics Anonymous is one method our groups use to achieve their primary purpose of carrying the message to the addict who still suffers.  Some groups also have open meetings as a way of allowing non-addict friends and relatives of NA members to celebrate recovery anniversaries with them.</p>
            <p>A <b>"closed"</b> meeting in Narcotics Anonymous is for those individuals who identify themselves as addicts or for those who are uncertain and think they might have a drug problem.  A closed Narcotics Anonymous meeting provides a freedom that is necessary for more personal and intimate sharing by Narcotics Anonymous members.  It does so by providing an atmosphere in which addicts can feel more certain that those attending will be able to identify with them, and share their own experience, strength, and hope.</p>
            <h2 id="na-sponsorship">Sponsorship</h2>
            <div class="leaflet-image-container">
              <a href="/leaflets/narcotics-anonymous/AN3111.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/about/meeting-types/narcotics-anonymous/sponsorship.png" /></a>
            </div>
            <p>One of the first suggestions many of us hear when we begin attending NA meetings is to get a sponsor. Sponsorship is a personal and private relationship that can mean different things to different people. An NA sponsor is a member of Narcotics Anonymous, living our programme of recovery, who is willing to build a special, supportive, one-on-one relationship with us. Most members think of a sponsor, first and foremost, as someone who can help us work the Twelve Steps of NA, and sometimes the Twelve Traditions and Twelve Concepts.</p>
            <p>Sponsors share their experience, strength, and hope with their sponsees. Some describe their sponsor as loving and compassionate, someone they can count on to listen and support them no matter what. Others value the objectivity and detachment a sponsor can offer, relying on their direct and honest input even when it may be difficult to accept. Still others turn to a sponsor mainly for guidance through the Twelve Steps.</p>
            <p>Sponsorship works for the same reason that NA works — because recovering members share common bonds of addiction and recovery and, in many cases, can empathize with each other. A sponsor’s role is not that of a legal advisor, a banker, a parent, a marriage counsellor, or a social worker. Nor is a sponsor a therapist offering some sort of professional advice. A sponsor is simply another addict in recovery who is willing to share his or her journey through the Twelve Steps.</p>
            <h2 id="na-service-commitments">Service Commitments</h2>
            <p>Setting up chairs, buying literature, arranging for speakers, cleaning up after the meeting, paying the bills, preparing refreshments – most of the things an NA group does to host its meetings are pretty simple. But if one person had to do them all, those simple things would quickly become overwhelming. When group members agree to serve as secretary or treasurer or tea or coffee-maker, that acceptance of responsibility often helps advance their personal growth. It also gives them a chance to help enhance the group’s ability to carry the recovery message.</p>
            <h2 id="na-religion">Religion</h2>
            <p>As soon as the word “God” comes up in casual conversation they are inclined to run the other direction. However, it is very important to understand the difference between spirituality and religion before entering into any program of recovery. Groups like Narcotics Anonymous have one goal, and one goal only. They are designed to help individuals get and stay sober. These groups are not discriminating – the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using drugs. After that, everything else is open to interpretation.</p>
            <p>It is required that when working the steps of Narcotics Anonymous, the individual in question “comes to believe in a power higher than themselves.” Does this mean “God” by religious standards? No. Coming to believe in a power higher than yourself simply means understanding and actively acknowledging that you – in and of yourself – are not the end all be all. Your addiction is more powerful than you are, therefore something outside of yourself must be capable of contributing to your recovery.</p>
            <h2 id="na-anonymity">Anonymity</h2>
            <div class="leaflet-image-container">
              <a href="assets/images/about/meeting-types/narcotics-anonymous/anonymity.png" target="_blank"> <img src="assets/images/about/meeting-types/narcotics-anonymous/anonymity.png" /></a>
            </div>
            <p>The basic premise of anonymity allows addicts to attend meetings without fear of legal or social repercussions. This is an important consideration for an addict thinking about going to his first meeting. Anonymity also supports an atmosphere of equality in meetings. It helps insure that no individual's personality or circumstance will be considered more important than the message of recovery shared in NA. We ask your help in maintaining our tradition of personal anonymity by not identifying our members by name or in full-face photos as members of Narcotics Anonymous, or by describing details of their personal circumstances, which could reveal their identities. </p>
            <p>In carrying our message of recovery, we welcome articles about our fellowship, but not in terms of personalities. We are not secret, just anonymous. Cooperation by the press has been very good, and we hope that continued exposure given to the Narcotics Anonymous program plays a major role in attracting the many thousands of addicts who need help. We thank you for your understanding.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Overeaters Anonymous is a Fellowship of individuals who, through shared experience, strength, and hope, are recovering from compulsive overeating. We welcome everyone who wants to stop eating compulsively. There are no dues or fees for members; we are self-supporting through our own contributions, neither soliciting nor accepting outside donations.</p>
            <p>OA is not affiliated with any public or private organization, political movement, ideology, or religious doctrine; we take no position on outside issues. Our primary purpose is to abstain from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviours and to carry the message of recovery through the Twelve Steps of OA to those who still suffer.</p>
            <p>If you have tried to achieve a healthy body weight through many methods, only to fail repeatedly, or if your inability to control your eating is beginning to frighten you, then please consider attending an OA meeting. You are no longer alone. We, too, have experienced hopelessness when we tried to control our problems with food or eating. We have tried every diet and used many methods to control our body size, without success. We could not enjoy life because of our obsession with food, weight, and/or size. We could not stop eating too much even when we really wanted to. At times, some of us even refused to eat because we were afraid we would be overcome by our appetite. We felt shame and humiliation about our behaviour with food. <a href="/leaflets/overeaters-anonymous/where-do-i-start-everything-a-newcomer-needs-to-know.pdf" target="_blank">Where Do I Start?</a></p>
            <p>Founded in 1960, the OA approach is based on the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), which focuses on physical, emotional, and spiritual elements. OA believes that compulsive eating is a disease like alcoholism, which is why it is based on the Twelve Steps of AA.</p>
            <p>At OA meetings, you will find others who have the same concerns and who share your feelings. Chances are you will find many of the answers you need. Overeaters Anonymous is a simple program that works. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop eating compulsively.</p>
            <h2 id="oa-how-it-works">How it Works?</h2>
            <div class="leaflet-image-container">
              <a href="/leaflets/overeaters-anonymous/tools-of-recovery-abridged.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/about/meeting-types/overeaters-anonymous/the-tools-of-recovery.png" /></a>
            </div>
            <p>Overeaters Anonymous offers recovery tools for people experiencing compulsive eating, binge eating, and other eating disorders. The organization follows a 12-step approach and is cantered on group meetings and sponsors to aid with recovery.</p>
            <p>Our symptoms may vary, but we share a common bond: we are powerless over food, and our lives have become unmanageable. This common problem has led those in OA to seek and find a common solution in the Twelve Steps with the assistance of the Twelve Traditions of OA and our Nine Tools. <a href="/leaflets/overeaters-anonymous/tools-of-recovery-abridged.pdf" target="_blank">The Tools of Recovery</a>.</p>
            <p>We in OA believe we have a threefold illness — physical, emotional, and spiritual. Tens of thousands have found that OA’s Twelve Step program brings recovery on all three levels. The Twelve Steps embody a set of actions we take. These Steps put us in touch with a Higher Power who restores us to sanity. As we work the Steps, we let go of old attitudes, and we find we are being relieved of our obsession with our eating disorder. Those of us who choose to work the Steps, one day at a time, achieve a new way of life with lasting freedom from our food obsession.</p>
            <p>OA is a community of people who support each other in order to recover from compulsive eating and food behaviours. When you arrive at an OA meeting, you will find men and women who share a common problem — compulsive eating — and who have found a common solution: the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous.</p>
            <p>The reasons for attendance are as diverse as the members. Some are there to determine if they have food issues, while others seek support as they recover from issues like compulsive overeating, food addiction, binge eating, and negative body image. Since OA members share a strained relationship with food, eating disorders may be common amongst OA members.</p>
            <p>As we work the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step program of recovery from compulsive eating, we have a number of Tools to assist us. We use these Tools — a plan of eating, sponsorship, meetings, telephone, writing, literature, action plan, anonymity, and service — on a regular basis, to help us achieve and maintain abstinence and recovery from our disease.</p>
            <h2 id="oa-meeting-formats">Meeting Formats</h2>
            <p>Meetings vary in size from as few as three members to fifteen or even more in larger towns. Many members attend more than one meeting a week. You will be warmly welcomed.</p>
            <p>The meeting usually opens with the Serenity Prayer, and you may hear a reading called “Our Invitation to You,” which describes the disease of compulsive overeating and the Twelve-Step solution. Meeting formats may vary, but all OA groups are the same in that they seek recovery on three levels — physical, emotional and spiritual — through the Twelve Steps, and the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop eating compulsively.</p>
            <p>You may hear a speaker open the meeting and speak for 10 to 15 minutes about what life was like before OA, what happened, and what he or she is like now; or someone might read from OA or AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) literature. Other members will share their experience, strength and hope. You will have an opportunity to introduce yourself as a newcomer, if you like. You will find that you are not alone, that there is a way out of your desperation.</p>
            <p>You may recognise your own story when you listen to others share. Listening will help you find others who have what you want, whether it be weight loss, clarity, joy in achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight, or freedom from the obsession of self-destructive eating behaviours.</p>
            <p>The designation of open and closed meetings have to do with the level of anonymity the group has chosen. If you think you have issues with food and are interested in exploring OA, you are welcome at any meeting — open or closed.</p>
            <p><b>Open Meeting:</b> Open to OA members and non-OA visitors. All meetings are considered open unless otherwise indicated. </p>
            <p><b>Closed Meeting:</b> Restricted to those who desire to stop eating compulsively (OA members and others who think they may have a problem with food).</p>
            <p>If you are interested in OA for another reason, like you are studying to be a nurse, doctor, or therapist, or are a concerned family member, we ask that you only attend open meetings.</p>
            <h2 id="oa-sponsorship">Sponsorship</h2>
            <div class="leaflet-image-container">
              <a href="https://www.oagb.org.uk/product/sponsoring-through-the-12-steps/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/about/meeting-types/overeaters-anonymous/sponsoring-through-the-twelve-steps.png" /></a>
            </div>
            <p>Sponsors are OA members who are living the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions to the best of their ability. They are willing to share their recovery with other members of the Fellowship and are committed to abstinence. Ask a member who has what you want from the program and how he or she is achieving it. A member may work with more than one sponsor and may change sponsors at will. A sponsor will work with you through the Twelve Steps of Overeaters Anonymous.</p>
            <p>Sponsors work one-on-one with another compulsive eater sharing what works for them, walking alongside their sponsees. They use and share OA Tools and slogans, study, work and apply the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, and offer support when it’s needed. This connection to a Higher Power, to spiritual Principles and practices, and to other recovering OA members — is a crucial part to recovery. <a href="/leaflets/overeaters-anonymous/a-sponsors-toolbox.pdf" target="_blank">A Sponsors Toolbox</a>.</p>
            <p>Usually the question of becoming a sponsor comes up in two ways: our own sponsor indicates that it is time, or someone asks us to sponsor them.</p>
            <p>There are no specific qualifications for sponsorship in OA. Although some members insist sponsors should have completed the first three steps, or must have completed their step four inventory, there are no such official requirements. Sponsors share their program up to the level of their own experience.</p>
            <p>A sponsor isn’t responsible for the failures or the successes of a sponsee. You can’t get someone abstinent if they don’t want to be abstinent, and you can’t prevent them from getting abstinent if they want to be abstinent. Don’t expect success; and don’t fear failure. It’s not up to you. The acceptance and practice of the OA recovery program rests entirely with the individual.</p>
            <h2 id="oa-service-commitments">Service Commitments</h2>
            <div class="leaflet-image-container">
              <a href="https://www.oagb.org.uk/product/12-concepts-of-service/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/about/meeting-types/overeaters-anonymous/the-twelve-concepts-of-oa-service.png" /></a>
            </div>
            <p>Service is one of OA’s Tools of Recovery which help us achieve and maintain abstinence, and is vital in helping us fulfil our primary purpose of carrying the OA message to the compulsive eater who still suffers.</p>
            <p>Any form of service that helps a reach fellow sufferer adds to the quality of our own recovery. Members can give service by getting to meetings, putting away chairs, putting out literature, and talking to newcomers. Beyond the group level, a member can serve as intergroup representative, committee chair, region representative, or Conference delegate. As OA’s responsibility pledge states, "Always to extend the hand and heart of OA to all who share my compulsion; for this, I am responsible."</p>
            <p>The 12 Concepts of OA Service help us apply the Steps and Traditions in our service work. The Concepts define and guide the practices of the service structures that conduct the business of OA and are a useful resource for groups and Intergroups. <a href="https://oa.org/service-bodies/twelve-concepts/" target="_blank">The Twelve Concepts of OA Service</a>.</p>
            <p>You can publicise your meetings in lots of ways. The Public Information Service Manual is available to purchase from the OAGB Literature Service and contains lots of useful information and ideas about this.</p>
            <h2 id="oa-religion">Religion</h2>
            <div class="leaflet-image-container">
              <a href="https://www.oagb.org.uk/product/if-god-spoke-to-oa/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/about/meeting-types/overeaters-anonymous/if-god-spoke-to-oa.png" /></a>
            </div>
            <p>OA is not a religious organization. OA members are people of many religious faiths as well as atheists and agnostics. The OA recovery program is based on acceptance of certain spiritual principles. Members are free to interpret these principles as they think best, or not to think about them at all if they so choose. <a href="https://oa.org/working-the-program/atheists-and-agnostics-are-welcome/" target="_blank">Atheists and Agnostics are Welcome</a>.</p>
            <p>Many individuals who come to OA have reservations about accepting any concept of a power greater than themselves. OA experience has shown that those who keep an open mind on this subject and continue coming to OA meetings will not find it too difficult to work out their own solution to this very personal matter.</p>
            <p>We don’t all think alike. As stated in The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous, page ix, "Our common bonds are two: the disease of compulsive eating from which we all have suffered, and the solution that we all are finding as we live by the principles embodied in these Steps." This is what unites us in OA. As the Third Tradition states, if we have the desire to stop eating compulsively, there is a place for us in OA. Anyone who has this desire is welcome and should never feel like they have to explain their personal beliefs.</p>
            <p>"Open-mindedness is key to success, as we read in The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous." OA doesn’t tell us we have to believe in God — only that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</p>
            <p>People who find success in OA work this program with their own concept of a Higher Power, regardless of their personal interpretation of that power. Clarity, peace of mind, and growth are some of the many by-products of OA’s recovery program. When we stay in the program and apply these principles in keeping with a personal understanding of a Higher Power, these rich rewards are ours! These are certainly good reasons to ‘keep coming back’.</p>

            <p>Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities. Anonymity assures us that only we, as individual OA members, have the right to make our membership known to others. Anonymity at the level of press, radio, films, television, and other public media of communication means that we never allow our faces or last names to be used once we identify ourselves as OA members. <a href="/leaflets/overeaters-anonymous/guidelines-for-anonymity-in-the-digital-world.pdf" target="_blank">Guidelines for Anonymity in the Digital World</a>.</p>
            <p>Tradition Eleven addresses the need for members to be anonymous outside the Fellowship at the level of public media. By following this Tradition, we guard against the assumption that any one person’s recovery represents OA as a whole. We also guard against the temptation for an individual to seek public recognition. Members who ignore our Eleventh Tradition can cause damage to OA’s spirit of fellowship, which is essential to our personal healing. Such breaks of anonymity may bring the OA name before the public, but they can also bring jealousy and competition for publicity and financial rewards. We must be willing to surrender our need for recognition to protect our recovery and OA as a whole</p>
            <p>Within the Fellowship, anonymity means that whatever we share with another OA member will be respected and kept confidential. What we hear at meetings should remain there.<br /><br /></p>
