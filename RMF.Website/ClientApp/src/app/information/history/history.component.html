          </div>
          <p>AA had its beginnings in 1935 at Akron, Ohio, as the outcome of a meeting between Bill Wilson, a New York stockbroker, and Dr. Bob Smith, an Akron surgeon. Both had been hopeless alcoholics.</p>
          <p>Bill W. was born on November 26, 1895, in East Dorset, Vermont, the son of Emily (née Griffith) and Gilman Barrows Wilson. He was born at his parents' home and business, the Mount Aeolus Inn and Tavern. His paternal grandfather, William C. Wilson, was also an alcoholic. Both of Bill's parents abandoned him soon after he and his sister were born his father never returned from a purported business trip, and his mother left Vermont to study osteopathic medicine. Bill and his sister were raised by their maternal grandparents, Fayette and Ella Griffith. As a teen, Bill showed little interest in his academic studies and was rebellious. Wilson met his wife Lois Burnham during the summer of 1913, while sailing on Vermont's Emerald Lake; two years later the couple became engaged. He entered Norwich University, but depression and panic attacks forced him to leave during his second semester. </p>

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Duncan_Silkworth" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/about/history/alcoholics-anonymous/william-duncan-silkworth.png" /><span class="image-caption">William Silkworth</span></a>
          </div>
          <p>In 1933 Wilson was committed to the Charles B. Towns Hospital for Drug and Alcohol Addictions in New York City four times under the care of William Duncan Silkworth. Silkworth's theory was that alcoholism was a matter of both physical and mental control: a craving, the manifestation of a physical allergy (the physical inability to stop drinking once started) and an obsession of the mind (to take the first drink). Wilson gained hope from Silkworth's assertion that alcoholism was a medical condition, but even that knowledge could not help him. He was eventually told that he would either die from his alcoholism or have to be locked up permanently due to Wernicke encephalopathy (commonly referred to as "wet brain").</p>
          <p>In November 1934, Wilson was visited by old drinking companion Ebby Thacher. Wilson was astounded to find that Thacher had been sober for several weeks under the guidance of the evangelical Christian Oxford Group. Wilson took some interest in the group, but shortly after Thacher's visit, he was again admitted to Towns Hospital to recover from a bout of drinking. This was his fourth and last stay at Towns Hospital under Silkworth's care and he showed signs of delirium tremens. There, Bill W had a "White Light" spiritual experience and quit drinking Earlier that evening, Thacher had visited and tried to persuade him to turn himself over to the care of Jesus Christ who would liberate him from alcohol. According to Wilson, while lying in bed depressed and despairing, he cried out, "I'll do anything! Anything at all! If there be a God, let Him show Himself!" He then had the sensation of a bright light, a feeling of ecstasy, and a new serenity. He never drank again for the remainder of his life. Wilson described his experience to Silkworth, who told him, "Something has happened to you I don't understand. But you had better hang on to it".</p>
          <div class="image-container" style="margin-top: 10px">
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Smith_(doctor)" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/about/history/alcoholics-anonymous/dr-bob-smith.png" /><span class="image-caption">Dr. Bob Smith</span></a>
          </div>
          <p>Bill W. joined the Oxford Group and tried to help other alcoholics, but succeeded only in keeping sober himself. During a failed business trip to Akron, Ohio, Wilson was tempted to drink again and decided that to remain sober he needed to help another alcoholic. He called phone numbers in a church directory and eventually secured an introduction to Bob Smith, an alcoholic Oxford Group member. Wilson explained Silkworth's theory that alcoholics suffer from a physical allergy and a mental obsession. Wilson shared that the only way he was able to stay sober was through having had a spiritual experience. Smith was familiar with the tenets of the Oxford Group and upon hearing Wilson's experience, "began to pursue the spiritual remedy for his malady with a willingness that he had never before been able to muster. </p>
          <p>After meeting Bill W. the effect on the Dr. Bob was immediate. This time, he found himself face to face with a fellow sufferer who had made good. Bill emphasized that alcoholism was a malady of mind, emotions and body. This all-important fact he had learned from Dr. William D. Silkworth of Towns Hospital in New York, where Bill had often been a patient. Though a physician, Dr. Bob had not known alcoholism to be a disease. Responding to Bill's convincing ideas, he soon got sober, never to drink again. The founding spark of Alcoholics Anonymous had been struck.</p>
          <p>Both men immediately set to work with alcoholics at Akron's City Hospital, where one patient quickly achieved complete sobriety. Though the name Alcoholics Anonymous had not yet been coined, these three men actually made up the nucleus of the first AA group. In the fall of 1935, a second group of alcoholics slowly took shape in New York. A third appeared at Cleveland in 1939. It had taken over four years to produce 100 sober alcoholics in the three founding groups.</p>
          <h2 id="aa-publications">Publications</h2>
          <div class="image-container">
            <a href="https://www.aa.org/the-big-book" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/about/history/alcoholics-anonymous/alcoholics-anonymous-big-book-first-edition.png" /><span class="image-caption">AA Big Book</span></a>
          </div>
          <p>Early in 1939, the Fellowship published its basic textbook, Alcoholics Anonymous. The text, written by Bill, explained AA's philosophy and methods, the core of which was the now well-known Twelve Steps of recovery. The book was also reinforced by case histories of some thirty recovered members. From this point, AA's development was rapid.</p>
          <p>Also in 1939, the Cleveland Plain Dealer carried a series of articles about AA, supported by warm editorials. The Cleveland group of only twenty members was deluged by countless pleas for help. Alcoholics sober only a few weeks were set to work on brand-new cases. This was a new departure, and the results were fantastic. A few months later, Cleveland's membership had expanded to 500. For the first time, it was shown that sobriety could be mass-produced.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, in New York, Dr. Bob and Bill had in 1938 organized an over-all trusteeship for the budding Fellowship. Friends of John D. Rockefeller Jr. became board members alongside a contingent of AAs. This board was named The Alcoholic Foundation. However, all efforts to raise large amounts of money failed, because Mr. Rockefeller had wisely concluded that great sums might spoil the infant society. Nevertheless, the foundation managed to open a tiny office in New York to handle inquiries and to distribute the Alcoholics Anonymous book — an enterprise which, by the way, had been mostly financed by the AAs themselves.</p>
          <p>The book and the new office were quickly put to use. An article about AA was carried by Liberty magazine in the fall of 1939, resulting in some 800 urgent calls for help. In 1940, Mr. Rockefeller gave a dinner for many of his prominent New York friends to publicize AA. This brought yet another flood of pleas. Each inquiry received a personal letter and a small pamphlet. Attention was also drawn to the book Alcoholics Anonymous, which soon moved into brisk circulation. Aided by mail from New York, and by AA travellers from already-established centres, many new groups came alive. At the year's end, the membership stood at 2,000.</p>
          <p>Then, in March 1941, the Saturday Evening Post featured an excellent article about AA, and the response was enormous. By the close of that year, the membership had jumped to 6,000, and the number of groups multiplied in proportion. Spreading across the U.S. and Canada, the Fellowship mushroomed.</p>

          </div>
          <p>By 1950, 100,000 recovered alcoholics could be found worldwide. Spectacular though this was, the period 1940-1950 was nonetheless one of great uncertainty. The crucial question was whether all those mercurial alcoholics could live and work together in groups. Could they hold together and function effectively? This was the unsolved problem. Corresponding with thousands of groups about their problems became a chief occupation of the New York headquarters.</p>
          <p>By 1946, however, it had already become possible to draw sound conclusions about the kinds of attitude, practice and function that would best suit AA's purpose. Those principles, which had emerged from strenuous group experience, were codified by Bill in what are today the Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous. By 1950, the earlier chaos had largely disappeared. A successful formula for AA unity and functioning had been achieved and put into practice.</p>
          <p>During this hectic ten-year period, Dr. Bob devoted himself to the question of hospital care for alcoholics, and to their indoctrination with AA principles. Large numbers of alcoholics flocked to Akron to receive hospital care at St. Thomas, a Catholic hospital. Dr. Bob became a member of its staff. Subsequently, he and the remarkable Sister M. Ignatia, also of the staff, cared for and brought AA to some 5,000 sufferers. After Dr. Bob's death in 1950, Sister Ignatia continued to work at Cleveland's Charity Hospital, where she was assisted by the local groups and where 10,000 more sufferers first found AA. This set a fine example of hospitalization wherein AA could cooperate with both medicine and religion.</p>
          <p>Had it not been for AA's early friends, Alcoholics Anonymous might never have come into being. And without its host of well-wishers who have since given of their time and effort — particularly those friends of medicine, religion, and world communications — AA could never have grown and prospered. The Fellowship here records its constant gratitude.</p>
          <p>Since then, AA has become truly global, and this has revealed that AA's way of life can today transcend most barriers of race, creed and language. A World Service Meeting, started in 1969, has been held biennially since 1972. Its locations alternate between New York and overseas. It has met in London, England; Helsinki, Finland; San Juan del Rio, Mexico; Guatemala City, Guatemala; Munich, Germany and Cartagena, Colombia.</p>
          <h2 id="aa-conventions">Conventions</h2>
          <p>In this same year of 1950, AA held its first International Convention at Cleveland. There, Dr. Bob made his last appearance and keyed his final talk to the need of keeping AA simple. Together with all present, he saw the Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous enthusiastically adopted for the permanent use of the AA Fellowship throughout the world. (He died on November 16, 1950.)</p>

            <a href="https://www.aagrapevine.org/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/about/history/alcoholics-anonymous/grapevine-magazine.png" /><span class="image-caption">Grapevine Magazine</span></a>
          </div>
          <p>The following year witnessed still another significant event. The New York office had greatly expanded its activities, and these now consisted of public relations, advice to new groups, services to hospitals, prisons, Loners, and Internationalists, and cooperation with other agencies in the alcoholism field. The headquarters was also publishing "standard" AA books and pamphlets, and it supervised their translation into other tongues. Our international magazine, the AA Grapevine, had achieved a large circulation. These and many other activities had become indispensable for AA as a whole.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, these vital services were still in the hands of an isolated board of trustees, whose only link to the Fellowship had been Bill and Dr. Bob. As the co-founders had foreseen years earlier, it became absolutely necessary to link AA's world trusteeship (now the General Service Board of Alcoholics Anonymous) with the Fellowship that it served. Delegates from all states and provinces of the U.S. and Canada were forthwith called in. Thus composed, this body for world service first met in 1951. Despite earlier misgivings, the gathering was a great success. For the first time, the remote trusteeship became directly accountable to AA as a whole. The AA General Service Conference had been created, and AA's over-all functioning was thereby assured for the future.</p>
          <p>A second International Convention was held in St. Louis in 1955 to celebrate the Fellowship's 20th anniversary. The General Service Conference had by then completely proved its worth. Here, on behalf of AA's old-timers, Bill turned the future care and custody of AA over to the Conference and its trustees. At this moment, the Fellowship went on its own; AA had come of age.</p>
          <p>It was on January 24, 1971, that Bill, a victim of pneumonia, died in Miami Beach, Florida, where — seven months earlier — he had delivered at the 35th Anniversary International Convention what proved to be his last words to fellow AAs: "God bless you and Alcoholics Anonymous forever."</p>

          </div>
          <p>The venue for AA's first meeting in Great Britain was pretty classy — London's Dorchester Hotel. Grace Oursler, an American AA, visiting London had been asked by GSO in New York to contact several people in Britain who wanted information about AA. Amongst them were Chris B, probably the first person in England to use AA to attain sobriety, 'Canadian' Bob B, an American serviceman Sergeant Vernon W, and Norman R-W, who was still drinking. The meeting was held in Room 202 of the hotel at 8 p.m. on Monday 31st March 1947. Others attending the meeting were Tony F, an Irish airman, Flash W, an American and Pat G, a female member from California whom Grace had met on the voyage.</p>
          <p>In the same way that early American meetings had been held in members' homes meetings were held in Canadian Bob's house in Mortlake Road, Kew Gardens as well as in cafés.</p>
          <p>Progress was slow at first but when Canadian Bob visited new members Alan and wife Winnie in Bolton he informed them that they were the Bolton Group. In November 1948 the Group held its first meeting in the Millgate Hotel, Manchester.</p>
          <p>When Canadian Bob introduced Bill H to sobriety in AA our service structure expanded with Bill's office in the London Fruit Exchange providing the fellowship with a postal address (BM/AAL London WC1) and a contact number (Bishopgate 9657) available Monday to Friday.</p>
          <p>By January 1949 meetings in London were being held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11 Chandos Street and membership had passed the magic 100.</p>
          <p>In 1952 AA began to lease 11 Redcliffe Gardens with the Central Committee managing it as the Central Service Office. In 1970 it became the General Service Office under the management of the General Service Board. When GSO relocated to Stonebow House in York in 1986 the London Regional Telephone office remained at Redcliffe Gardens until January 1999 when it moved into the Regional Service Office (London) at Jacob House and Redcliffe Gardens passed out of AA history.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile in Scotland the Oxford Groups had an instrumental role in AA beginnings as they had in America. The wife of Philip D, an active alcoholic, attended an Oxford Group in Scotland and heard about the Groups' role in the start of AA. Philip visited America in 1948 and attended meetings before returning to Scotland and carrying the message. Forbes C got involved and meetings began in Perth, Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1949.</p>
          <p>Cathedral Road, Cardiff was the location of the first AA meeting in Wales. The meeting took place on Friday 13th April 1951 with five attendees.</p>

          <p>C.A. was formed in Los Angeles in 1982 by the late Johnny Segal and several others. Seagal worked in the film industry and saw a number of people who had difficulty finding help from anyone knowledgeable about the special difficulties presented by cocaine addiction.</p>
          <p>In November 1982, Johnny S. receives a call from Tom K. from the Motion Picture Health & Welfare Fund in Hollywood, California, who plans to start an AA Meeting for drug addicts, especially cocaine addicts. "In those days, you could go to AA meetings and if you talked about drugs, they asked you to leave."</p>
          <p>The first meeting of C.A. is held on Thursday, November 18, 1982, at the Motion Picture Health and Welfare Fund building at 335 North La Brea in Hollywood (North of Beverly Blvd.), California. Veronica Jo K. is the secretary and calls the meeting to order with a gavel and announces: “Welcome to the first meeting of Cocaine Anonymous, a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other and help others recover from their addiction.</p>
          <p>In November-December 1982 The Beverly Glen Hospital provided a room for a weekly, free “Cocaine Anonymous” meeting open to drug abusers. (This became the 2nd meeting of Cocaine Anonymous and its first H & I meeting.) The group now averages 30 people. Psychotherapist Allan Rosenthal said the response from doctors and other health-care professionals has been “so overwhelming” that he envisions a mushrooming "Cocaine Anonymous" organization in Los Angeles, complete with a telephone hotline, literature and an administrative.</p>
          <p>In February 1983 – The secretaries of the six C.A. meetings got together and formed what eventually became the first General Services Organization and in April 1983, the Los Angeles Central Office was formed.</p>
          <p>In April 11, 1983, Time Magazine Cover features a story on fighting cocaine’s grip on millions of users. The article references Cocaine Anonymous… "In Los Angeles, new Cocaine Anonymous groups draw 700 people to weekly meetings."</p>
          <p>Ray G. is in charge of the Cocaine Anonymous phone number. It rings on an answering machine in a small Beverly Glen Hospital room and Ray G. returns most of the calls. The room and phone machine are provided by Beverly Glen Hospital. C.A. sets up a hotline phone number during the first year. Ray G. manages the hotline for the first year. "If any of you called in the first year of existence of Cocaine Anonymous and talked to the man on the telephone, that was Ray G. - who took all the calls for the first year of Cocaine Anonymous."</p>

          <p>In November 23, 1983. Gil M. orders 1500 chips. They will be available through the General Services Office for $2.50 per chip. Gil will be responsible for sales. C.A. chips (30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 2 years — there was no 'newcomer' or 18 month chip) were square in shape, with the letters "CA" printed on them. It was found that people were using these square chips to chop up cocaine. At this same time, some others Area’s of C.A. (of course none of them had met together yet) had also created chips. Atlanta had chips, Chicago had chips, and Northern California had chips.</p>
          <p>The words Hope, Faith and Courage were not the original words for the logo. Originally, the words were going to be "Hope, Faith and Willingness." They wanted to put these words into the circle around C.A., but the word Willingness wouldn’t fit. Johnny Segal, a founding member, was listening to a speech by John F. Kennedy about having courage to do difficult things in your life. Johnny felt the word Courage would fit in the circle, and would be appropriate. The members at the time voted for this logo.</p>
          <h2 id="ca-conventions">Conventions</h2>
          <p>Between May 3-5, 1985, 1st World Convention: Seaside Unity & Acceptance, Santa Barbara, C.A. In 1985 it was decided to have the first convention of C.A. Fellowships to be held in Santa Barbara California. Members from C.A. meetings from across the United States attended. It was an incredibly exciting event. During the convention, a three-hour business meeting was held to let the fellowships know what the fledgling World Service organization was doing. It was decided the next year to have the first World Service Conference.</p>
          <p>The first World Service Conference was held in San Diego in February 1986, adjacent to a World Service Convention. The Conference lasted two days.</p>
          <p>When Northern California came down to this original conference, they sent six representatives and all wearing T-shirts with the C.A. logo that they had created. Later at the 3rd World Conference in March 1987, there was vote between the logo that CALA had created, and the logo that Northern California created. The CALA (C.A. Los Angeles) logo with HOPE, FAITH AND COURAGE won and is the official logo we have today. The logo was to be put on the new key tag round chips. In Northern California created the first metal chip, with their logo, with the serenity prayer (with Cocaine Anonymous around the number) on the back, and ca and HOPE FAITH AND COURAGE on the front. It was an error that the words Cocaine Anonymous were on the back!  Since Northern California had the first metal chip, the chip company would not make chips for CA World Service. So at the 3rd World Conference in March 1987, Northern California deeded to World Service the right to make metal chips.</p>

          <p>James Patrick Kinnon, known as "Jimmy K.", is commonly credited with founding Narcotics Anonymous (NA) in 1953 in Los Angeles, California, for the purpose of helping its members stop using addictive substances.</p>
          <p>At the time, Alcoholics Anonymous had been in existence for almost 20 years, gaining international recognition for helping its members stop using alcohol. However, AA focused only on alcohol and not drug use. Kinnon recognized the benefits of the AA 12-step program and how a 12-step model could also help those with drug use problems.</p>
          <p>The AA granted Kinnon permission to adopt and change the AA Twelve Steps. For the NA twelve steps, he changed the wording in Step 1 from 'powerless over alcohol' to 'powerless over our addiction.' That is significant as it changed the focus on the addiction rather than on the abused substance.</p>
          <p>Narcotics Anonymous was officially established in Sun Valley, California, in July 1953. At that time, NA was not yet recognized by society at large as a positive force. The initial group had difficulty finding places that would allow them to meet and often had to meet in people's homes. The first meetings of Narcotics Anonymous were held in the basements of churches for the members' protection because at that time an old law prohibiting convicted felons from congregating was still being upheld and churches offered their basements as a sanctuary. Addicts would have to cruise around meeting places and check for surveillance, to make sure meetings would not be busted by police. It was many years before NA became recognized as a beneficial organization, although some early press accounts were very positive.</p>

          </div>
          <p>In 1954, the first NA publication was printed, called the "Little Brown Book". It contained the 12 steps and early drafts of several pieces that would later be included in subsequent literature.</p>
          <p>Many of Narcotics Anonymous’s early published works were written by Jimmy Kinnon and are now used globally at over 70,000 NA meetings. He was the key donor to the Yellow Booklet and Little White Booklet used in the 1960s and 1970s. From 1979 to 1982, a group of 1960s and 1970s NA members expanded it to create The Basic Text. The Basic Text was the first-ever known to have been published by recovered drug addicts to treat drug addicts. It was first released in 1982.</p>
          <p>Before the publication of NA's Basic Text in 1982, membership in the organization was low. Once they published the Basic Text, NA grew rapidly.</p>
          <p>The NA White Booklet was written in 1962 and became the heart of NA meetings and the basis for all subsequent NA literature. NA was called a "hip pocket program" because the entire literature could fit into a person's hip pocket. This booklet was republished in 1966 as the NA White Book and included the personal stories of many addicts.</p>
          <p>NA also offers many information pamphlets and NA booklets. In order to help members, these are available in many different languages throughout the world.</p>
          <h2 id="na-growth">Growth</h2>
          <p>By the end of 1983, NA had expanded into more than a dozen countries, offering almost 3,000 meetings worldwide. In the 20 years between its founding and publication of the Basic Text, word gradually spread, and meetings began to spring up in several large North American cities. NA also began to receive some international attention. </p>
          <p>The first meetings were fairly sporadic and were mainly restricted to California. Over the next few years NA grew very slowly. In addition, many NA groups were not following the 12 traditions very closely (which were quite new at the time). These groups were at times accepting money from outside entities, conflating AA with NA, or even adding religious elements to the meetings. For a variety of reasons, meetings began to decline in the late 1950s, and there was a four-month period in 1959 when there were no meetings held anywhere at all. Spurred into action by this, Kinnon and others dedicated themselves to restarting NA, promising to hold to the traditions more closely.</p>
          <p>In late 1959, meetings began to form again and grow. The first NA phone line started in 1960, and the first "H&I" group was formed in 1963 (H&I stands for Hospitals and Institutions, a sub-committee of Narcotics Anonymous that carries the message into hospitals and institutions where people cannot get to an outside meeting). That year a "Parent Service Board" (later renamed the World Service Board) was formed to ensure that NA stayed healthy and followed closely to the traditions. Confusingly, in 1962, the Salvation Army started a group also called "Narcotics Anonymous" that followed a different "13-step" program, but this program soon died out. The NA program grew slowly in the 1960s. Members of the program learned what was effective and what was not. Relapse rates declined over time and friction between NA groups began to decrease.</p>
          <p>The 1970s was a period of rapid growth in NA's history. In 1970, there were only 20 regular, weekly meetings, all of them in the United States. Within two years there were 70, including meetings in Germany, Australia, and Bermuda. By 1976, there were 200 regular meetings, including 83 in California alone, and in the early 1980s in Brazil, Canada, Colombia, India, the Republic of Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In 1980, the first London meeting opened in Millman Street, Chelsea, with around six members and a second followed months later. A World Service Office was officially opened in 1977. In 1971, the first NA World Conference was held, and others have followed annually.</p>
          <p>In the 1980s there was an explosive growth in NA meetings world-wide. There are currently estimated to be 63,000 weekly meetings in 132 countries worldwide.</p>
          <h2 id="na-in-ireland">NA in Ireland</h2>
          <p>Narcotics Anonymous in Ireland began in a very similar fashion to the world-wide fellowship. NA in Ireland can be traced back to 1978 when a group of addicts in Dublin who were attending AA decided to start their own meetings for people suffering from drug addiction. By 1981, there were 1,100 different meetings all over the world and in 1983 Mary Bolton founded Narcotics Anonymous in Ireland.</p>
          <p>These pioneers had no information about Narcotics Anonymous and so their first meeting, which was held in a treatment centre in Clondalkin, County Dublin, and went under the improvised title of Drugs Anonymous. The meeting wrote out a poster with a First Step that read "We admitted we were powerless over drugs, and that our lives had become unmanageable". The group used AA literature and members substituted the words alcohol and drugs for one another. The secretary of this group was Tom C. Sometime in early 1979 some NA literature was received from the World Service Office, and the group changed its name to Narcotics Anonymous. It is not clear how long this group continued to meet. A separate group started later that year, using the same poster from the original meeting, and held a Narcotics Anonymous meeting at the same venue on October 7, 1979, with Mark F. as the secretary. There have been NA meetings held in Ireland continuously since that date.</p>
          <p>Although the fellowship remained quite small for its first five years in existence, Dublin addicts were at last being given an opportunity of finding recovery and getting clean through the NA programme. Meetings also started in Drogheda and Limerick around this time.</p>
          <p>By 1983 there were no more than six NA groups in the country, but then two events occurred that were to lead to the rapid growth of NA within Ireland. The first was the publication of the first edition of the NA Basic Text, which helped cause a worldwide surge in the number of NA meetings. The second was a visit by Irish members to a “learning weekend’ in London. They returned to Ireland determined to create a local service structure, and this led to the creation of an Irish Area Service Committee (ASC), which was set up in a member’s flat in Rathmines, Dublin on May 14th 1983.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Overeaters Anonymous (OA) is a twelve-step program founded in 1960 for people with problems related to food including, but not limited to, compulsive overeaters, those with binge eating disorder, bulimics and anorexics. Anyone with a problematic relationship with food is welcomed; OA's Third Tradition states that the only requirement for memberships is a desire to stop eating compulsively.</p>
          <p>The first Overeaters Anonymous was formed on January 19, 1960, in Los Angeles, California. Only three women attended the first meeting, but the group has since grown to nearly 9,000 meetings in 51 countries. The group was the brainchild of Rozanne S. In January of 1959 she took a friend who was struggling with a gambling problem to a meeting of Gamblers Anonymous in Los Angeles. As she listened to the gamblers' personal stories, she found that she could identify with their struggle. Only it was not gambling that she had a problem with: it was food. And just as the members of that group termed their gambling "compulsive," Rozanne S. later termed her eating patterns and those that Overeaters Anonymous would deal with "compulsive eating."</p>
          <p>Rozanne S. left the meeting hoping that she could find a similar group for those who had problems overeating, but she could not find one. With the support of the founder of Gamblers Anonymous, Jim W., Rozanne S. started the first meeting of Overeaters Anonymous with one of her neighbours, Jo S., and Bernice K., the overweight wife of a G.A. member. Bernice dropped out of the group early on, stating, "My doctor says that dieting makes me nervous." The other two original members, however, were losing weight rapidly — 134 pounds between the pair in less than nine months.</p>

          </div>
          <p>OA has developed its own literature specifically for those who eat compulsively but also uses the Alcoholics Anonymous books Alcoholics Anonymous and Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions. The First Step of OA begins with the admission of powerlessness over food; the next eleven steps are intended to bring members "physical, emotional, and spiritual healing.</p>
          <p>Like many splinter groups from Alcoholics Anonymous, OA struggled with how much of the original text from the Alcoholics Anonymous "Big Book" to retain for their purposes. They were especially torn over what portion of the 12 Steps to edit, or whether to keep them in their entirety. (Appendix A) Rozanne S. initially rewrote the steps, omitting any reference to God. In a program that was based on spirituality, this was a daunting task. Step three was changed from "Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him," to advising consultation "with a physician of our own choosing." Rozanne S. admits that at this point no one in the group had actually been to a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. Her sole participation in a sanctioned 12-step program was her three-time attendance at Gamblers Anonymous, and she admits that her understanding of how A.A. functioned was tenuous at best.</p>
          <p>After attending an A.A. meeting that discussed the idea of abstinence, Rozanne decided that snacking between meals only reinforced her tendency to compulsively overeat. At the next meeting of Overeaters Anonymous, Rozanne introduced the idea of O.A.-sanctioned abstinence-three moderate meals with no snacking in between and only no-calorie beverages, such as black coffee and water. The new rules did make allowances for those whose doctors advised them to eat more frequently. This introduction of the first Overeaters Anonymous food plan sparked controversy that continues to roil the ranks of O.A. membership today.</p>
          <p>In 1963, the first so-called "Gold Sheet" was distributed among O.A. members. It was a food plan that recommended a diet for its members that included no refined carbohydrates; it was named after the colour of paper on which it was printed. Initially it was distributed informally and was not officially recognized by Overeaters Anonymous. The next year the same plan with slight variations was distributed on green paper and was thus referred to as the "Green Sheet."</p>
          <p>In May of 1966, the group as a whole, at their national conference, approved a pamphlet entitled, To the Newcomer. The pamphlet stated in part:</p>
          <p>Abstinence in Overeaters Anonymous means abstinence from compulsive overeating. An eating plan is the method by which we abstain. The following is our suggested method of abstinence from compulsive overeating:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Three moderate meals a day with nothing in-between; and</li>
            <li>Avoidance of all individual binge foods.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This was Overeaters Anonymous first officially sanctioned food plan, although many members lobbied the legislative body of O.A. to approve more stringent diet plans, like the ones found on the Gold and Green Sheets.</p>
          <p>In the late 1960s, the Gold and Green Sheets were superseded by a new plan on the cheapest colour to print on at the time, grey. The Grey Sheet became one of the most popular and controversial of all food plans distributed in Overeaters Anonymous. The plan called for complete abstinence from man-made sugars and starches and from any foods with more than a 10-percent carbohydrate content.</p>
          <p>In 1977, Overeaters Anonymous dismissed all of the plans that had been distributed years earlier and released in their stead a blue sheet called "Suggested Abstinence Guide for Losing Weight." The Blue Sheet, as it came to be called, officially replaced the Grey Sheet, but many in the group were not happy with this change. With each successive change in food plan, Overeaters Anonymous lost members to splinter groups.</p>
          <p>By 1978, O.A. was starting to realize that the constant changes in food plans and lack of flexibility were costing it members. In 1979 the group released a book called The Dignity of Choice that was intended to bring the splinter groups back to the fold by including eight different food plans. The book did not succeed in its mission, however, and was discontinued.</p>
          <p>In 1986, not only did Overeaters Anonymous stop printing the book; the leadership requested that all groups return their unsold copies to the group's headquarters. Around this time, O.A.'s attorney also began sending cease and desist notices to groups that were distributing non-approved food plans using quotations from O.A. literature or printing the text of the 12 steps. These notices were sent primarily in reference to the "Grey Sheet."</p>
          <p>At the same time that Overeaters Anonymous stopped using The Dignity of Choice, it decided as a body that to endorse any specific food plan would go against the aims of the group and that O.A. should instead focus on the 12 steps of recovery. This was seen as a great step towards ending the controversies that had so bitterly divided the O.A. membership.</p>
          <p>Overeaters Anonymous basic text, often called the Brown Book, was originally published in 1980. The second edition came out in 2001. The current, third edition is from 2014. The book has significantly changed, since the first edition, with many new stories and appendices from professionals who have supported OA.</p>
          <h2 id="oa-growth">Growth</h2>
          <p>O.A. experienced phenomenal success in the first year. In November of 1960, Paul Coates interviewed Rozanne S. and some of the other original members on his syndicated television talk show. This was an amazing accomplishment for a group so new and must have bolstered the confidence of the fledgling group. Coates' show, after all, was where Rozanne S. had originally heard of Gamblers Anonymous, her original inspiration for starting Overeaters Anonymous. The show, which ran in six cities, brought the group, which at that point consisted of a handful of members, more than 500 letters. O.A. grew by leaps and bounds after its first key piece of publicity.</p>
          <p>The organization's headquarters, or World Service Office, is located in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.</p>
          <p>Today, about 6,500 OA groups meet each week in over 75 countries. With 60,000 members worldwide divided into ten geographic regions and a virtual region, OA helps thousands of compulsive eaters find new life in recovery.</p>
